# Google Form Randomization Spammer

> A Tampermonkey userscript that automates filling out a Google Form by randomly selecting available non-text options and repeatedly submitting responses.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Purpose
This tool programmatically simulates responses on a Google Form by:
- Parsing each question on the form,
- Identifying non-text answer options (radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns),
- Randomly choosing one option for each question (skipping free-text fields),
- Submitting the form and optionally repeating the process.

**Intended use:** testing, development, and load-simulation on forms you own or have explicit permission to test.

---

## üß© Features
- Detects questions and available selectable options automatically.  
- Skips questions that require typing (text inputs).  
- Looping/repeat behavior to submit many responses.  
- Implemented as a Tampermonkey userscript (pure JavaScript).  
- Simple configuration for submission count and timing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A browser with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or another userscript manager installed.  
- Access to the Google Form you intend to test (you must own it or have permission).  
- Basic ability to edit the userscript to adjust the `@match` pattern or tweak selectors.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the userscript file.  
2. Open Tampermonkey and create a new script.  
3. Paste the userscript code from this repo into the new Tampermonkey script.  
4. Update the script header `@match` or `@include` line to target your Google Form URL.  
5. Save and enable the script.  
6. Open the target Google Form. The script will attempt to auto-select answers and submit responses.

### Configuration
Inside the script you can:
- Set the number of submissions or run indefinitely.  
- Add delays between selections and submissions to appear more human-like.  
- Adjust selectors or logic for forms with custom layouts or unusual question types.

## üìù Code Overview
- `main.js` (or the primary userscript file):  
  - Scans the form DOM to locate question blocks.  
  - Detects selectable options for each question (radio, checkbox, dropdown).  
  - Randomly picks an option per question and triggers submission.  
  - Ignores text-only questions to avoid typing arbitrary text.  
  - Contains loop/delay logic for repeated submissions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations & Ethics
- Use this script **only** on forms you own or where you have explicit authorization.  
- Automated submissions can violate Google‚Äôs Terms of Service and may trigger rate limits, CAPTCHA, or account restrictions.  
- Excessive automated traffic may impact the target service or other users. Adjust delays and volume responsibly.  
- This project is provided for testing and educational purposes; misuse is discouraged and may have legal or contractual consequences.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting
- If the script fails to find options, inspect the form DOM ‚Äî Google occasionally changes markup. Update selectors accordingly.  
- If submissions stop working, Google may have added anti-automation measures (CAPTCHAs, rate limits). The script cannot bypass those protections.  
- Ensure Tampermonkey is enabled and the `@match` pattern matches your form URL.
